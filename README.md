Project Overview

- Predicting house prices using machine learning algorithms in Python
- Utilizes a dataset of house features and prices to train and evaluate models

Key Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering to prepare data for modeling
- Multiple machine learning models trained and evaluated (e.g. linear regression, decision trees, random forest)
- Model selection based on performance metrics (e.g. mean absolute error, R-squared)
- Prediction functionality using the trained model

Dataset

- Contains information on various house attributes (e.g. number of bedrooms, square footage, location)
- Includes target variable (house price) for training and evaluation

Technologies Used

- Python programming language
- NumPy and Pandas libraries for data manipulation and analysis
- Scikit-learn library for machine learning modeling
- Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries for data visualization

Files and Folders

- Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) containing data exploration, modeling, and evaluation
- Python script (.py) containing the trained model and prediction function
- Dataset file (.csv)
- Requirements file (.txt) listing dependencies

Functionality

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Model training and evaluation
- Prediction using the trained model
- Data visualization and exploration
